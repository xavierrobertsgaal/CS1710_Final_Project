                            <p class="lead">Today's powerful AI systems are reshaping our world, offering unprecedented capabilities but also introducing new risks and challenges. As citizens, we need to understand these systems' impacts on our society, environment, and individual autonomy.</p>
                            <p>This guide explores three critical dimensions of AI responsibility: environmental impact, security implications, and autonomy concerns. Through interactive visualizations and data-driven insights, we'll examine how AI affects our daily lives and what we can do to promote responsible development.</p>

                        <p>Training large AI models requires enormous computational resources, leading to significant carbon emissions. A single large language model's training can emit as much carbon as five cars over their entire lifetimes.</p>

                        <p>The stacked area chart shows the monthly count of AI-related incidents, categorized by severity. High-severity incidents (green) are shown at the bottom, followed by medium (orange) and low-severity (blue) incidents. This visualization reveals the dramatic increase in AI incidents across all severity levels in recent years.</p>
                        <p>Use the time brush below to zoom into specific time periods and explore incident patterns.</p>

                        <p>The treemap visualization breaks down AI incidents by sector, with box size indicating the number of incidents. High-risk sectors like healthcare and transportation often experience more severe incidents due to their direct impact on human life.</p>
                        <p>Click on any sector to see details of a random incident from that domain.</p>

                        <p>The line chart tracks AI model performance on SWE-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating AI systems' ability to understand and modify complex software. Each point represents a model evaluation, with the red line showing the maximum score achieved over time.</p>
                        <p>Hover over points to see detailed model performance information. The rapid upward trajectory of scores demonstrates the accelerating pace of AI advancement.</p>

                        <p>Recent models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet have achieved scores above 50 on the SWE-Bench benchmark, demonstrating unprecedented capabilities in code understanding and modification. This level of performance suggests AI systems are approaching human-level capabilities in certain programming tasks.</p>

                    <div class="step" data-step="progress-3">
                        <p>The steep increase in performance, particularly in the last year, raises important questions about AI's role in its own development. As these systems become better at programming tasks, they could potentially accelerate their own improvement, making it crucial to establish robust safety measures now.</p>
