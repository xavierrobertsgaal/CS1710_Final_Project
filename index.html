                        <h2>AI's Hidden Environmental Cost</h2>
                        <p>As artificial intelligence becomes more integrated into our daily lives, from streaming recommendations to email filters, its environmental impact grows silently but significantly. Training these AI models requires massive amounts of computational power, leading to substantial carbon emissions.</p>
                        <p>This visualization reveals a striking pattern: AI-intensive tasks, shown in red, consistently produce more carbon emissions than traditional computing tasks. A single day of AI-enhanced video streaming can emit as much carbon as driving a car for several miles.</p>
                        <p>The circles represent different computing tasks, with their size showing carbon emissions. Red circles are tasks actively using AI, blue circles show passive AI use, and gray circles indicate no AI use. Larger circles mean higher emissions.</p>
                        <p>Notice how video streaming with AI recommendations (red) produces significantly more emissions than basic web browsing (gray). This difference highlights how AI features, while convenient, come with hidden environmental costs.</p>
                        <p>Try using the 'Group by AI Usage' button to see how tasks cluster by their AI intensity. This reveals that AI-heavy tasks consistently rank among the highest emitters.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step" data-step="climate-2">
                        <h2>Data Centers: The Global Impact</h2>
                        <p>Behind every AI model lies a network of massive data centers, spread across the globe. These digital factories run 24/7, consuming electricity at rates comparable to small cities. Their location and power source greatly affect their environmental impact.</p>
                        <p>The map reveals a crucial insight: data centers powered by renewable energy (shown in blue) have a fraction of the carbon footprint compared to those using fossil fuels (shown in red). This difference can be up to 10 times in some cases.</p>
                        <p>Each marker on the map represents a major data center. The color indicates its primary power source, while the size shows its computing capacity. Hover over any location to see detailed statistics.</p>
                        <p>Notice the concentration of green data centers in Northern Europe, where renewable energy is abundant. In contrast, many U.S. centers still rely heavily on fossil fuels.</p>
                        <p>This geographic disparity shows how the same AI model can have vastly different environmental impacts depending on where it's trained and deployed.</p>

                    <div class="step" data-step="climate-3">
                        <h2>The Rising Energy Demand</h2>
                        <p>As AI models grow larger and more complex, their energy consumption is increasing at an alarming rate. The latest models require more computing power than ever before, creating a growing challenge for sustainability.</p>
                        <p>This timeline shows a clear trend: energy consumption from AI training has doubled every few months since 2020. This growth rate far outpaces improvements in energy efficiency.</p>
                        <p>The graph tracks energy usage over time, with the blue line showing total consumption. Sharp spikes indicate the training of major new AI models. The steepening curve reveals accelerating energy demands.</p>
                        <p>Look at the dramatic jump in late 2022, coinciding with the release of large language models. A single training run now uses as much energy as a typical American household does in 20 years.</p>
                        <p>Without intervention, this trend suggests AI's energy consumption could exceed that of many countries within the next decade.</p>

                    <h2>AI Security Incidents</h2>
                    <div class="step" data-step="incidents-1">
                        <p>As AI systems become more powerful and widespread, they've become both targets and tools for security breaches. The past few years have seen an unprecedented rise in AI-related security incidents, from data theft to system manipulation.</p>
                        <p>The visualization reveals a troubling trend: high-severity incidents (shown in red) have increased five-fold since 2021. These aren't just minor glitches – they're serious breaches affecting millions of users.</p>
                        <p>The chart shows incidents by severity over time. The height of each colored area represents the number of incidents, with red showing high-severity cases at the bottom, followed by medium (orange) and low (blue) severity incidents.</p>
                        <p>Notice the sharp increase in red areas starting mid-2022, coinciding with the widespread adoption of generative AI. This suggests that as AI systems become more capable, they also become more attractive targets.</p>
                        <p>Use the time brush below to zoom into specific periods and explore how incident patterns have evolved.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step" data-step="incidents-2">
                        <p>Looking closer at recent incidents reveals concerning patterns in how AI systems are being compromised. These aren't just random attacks – they're increasingly sophisticated and targeted.</p>
                        <p>The data shows that over 60% of high-severity incidents involve AI systems being manipulated to bypass security measures or gain unauthorized access.</p>
                        <p>Each layer in the chart represents a different severity level. The steepness of each curve shows how quickly incident rates are changing. Sudden jumps often indicate new types of vulnerabilities being exploited.</p>
                        <p>The period from late 2022 to early 2023 shows a particularly worrying trend: high-severity incidents began outpacing lower-severity ones, suggesting attacks are becoming more sophisticated.</p>
                        <p>This pattern suggests we're in an arms race between AI security measures and those trying to exploit them.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step" data-step="incidents-3">
                        <p>Different sectors face different types of AI security challenges. Some industries are particularly vulnerable due to their reliance on AI for critical operations.</p>
                        <p>The treemap reveals that healthcare and financial services suffer the most severe incidents, likely due to their valuable data and critical infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>Each box represents a different sector, with size showing the number of incidents and color indicating severity. Larger boxes mean more incidents, while darker colors suggest more severe impacts.</p>
                        <p>Healthcare stands out with the largest box and darkest color, indicating both frequent and severe incidents. This is particularly concerning given the sensitive nature of medical data.</p>
                        <p>Click on any sector to see details of a specific incident, helping understand the real-world impact of these security breaches.</p>

                    <div class="step" data-step="progress-2">
                        <p>Recent breakthroughs have pushed AI capabilities beyond what many experts predicted. Models can now not only understand code but also modify it intelligently.</p>
                        <p>The latest scores above 50 on SWE-Bench represent a fundamental shift: AI systems can now handle complex programming tasks with human-like comprehension.</p>
                        <p>The red dots highlight record-breaking performances, each representing a significant leap forward. The clustering of these points shows how innovations are building upon each other rapidly.</p>

                        <p>These advances raise important questions about AI's role in software development and its potential impact on programming jobs.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step" data-step="progress-3">
                        <p>The accelerating pace of AI progress has broader implications for society. As these systems become more capable, they could potentially contribute to their own improvement.</p>
                        <p>The trend line suggests we're approaching a potential inflection point where AI systems could significantly augment or even automate aspects of AI development itself.</p>
                        <p>Looking at the most recent data points, we can see that improvement rates are not just maintaining but accelerating. Each new model seems to build on previous advances more quickly.</p>
                        <p>This self-reinforcing cycle of improvement raises important questions about control and safety. If AI systems can enhance themselves, how do we ensure they remain aligned with human interests?</p>
